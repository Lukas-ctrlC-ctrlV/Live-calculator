# Live Calculator with Selectable Operations
This is a basic web-based calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows the user to input two numbers and select an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) from a dropdown menu.
The result updates automatically as you change the inputs or operation.
Division by zero is safely handled by displaying an error message.
